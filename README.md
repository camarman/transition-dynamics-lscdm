# Transition dynamics in the $Λ_{\text{s}}$ CDM model: Implications for bound cosmic structures

We explore the predictions of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ CDM, a novel framework suggesting a rapid anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter
(dS) vacua transition in the late Universe, on bound cosmic structures. In its simplest version, the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda_{\rm s}$, abruptly switches sign from negative to positive, attaining its present-day value at a redshift of ${z_\dagger\sim 2}$.
The $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ CDM model emerges as a promising solution to major cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions,
as well as other less definite tensions. A key aspect of our investigation is examining the impact of the abrupt $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ CDM model
on the formation and evolution of bound cosmic structures. We identify three primary influences: (i) the negative cosmological constant
(AdS) phase for $z > z_\dagger$, (ii) the abrupt transition marked by a type II (sudden) singularity, leading to an abrupt increase in the
universe's expansion rate at $z=z_\dagger$, and (iii) an increased expansion rate in the late universe under a positive cosmological constant
for $z < z_\dagger$, compared to $\Lambda$ CDM. Utilizing the spherical collapse model, we investigate the non-linear evolution of bound cosmic
structures within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ CDM framework. We find that the virialization process of cosmic structures, and consequently their
matter overdensity, varies depending on whether the AdS-dS transition precedes or follows the turnaround. Specifically, structures virialize
with either increased or reduced matter overdensity compared to the Planck- $\Lambda$ CDM model, contingent on the timing of the transition.
Additionally, our results demonstrate that the sudden singularity does not result in the dissociation of bound systems. Despite its profound
nature, the singularity exerts only relatively weak effects on such systems, thereby reinforcing the model's viability in this context.
